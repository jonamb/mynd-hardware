# Teufel MYND Hardware Repository
This repository contains all hardware related files including 3d models, schematics and pcb-layout files in various formats.

# Project structure
## `CAD/`
Contains 3d construction files in Rhino, STEP and STL formats. 
For every format, individual parts are available as direct download or a 'complete' package is avialable containing the entire model.
Due to size, the complete model in STL format is compressed into 'complete.zip'.

## `PCB_Schematics/`
### `./Altium`
Contains Altium Designer PCB and schematic files for all PCBs.
### `./KiCad`
Contains KiCad PCB and schematic files for all PCBs. Please note: These files were converted from the Altium working files for convenience and may still contain some  conversion errors.
### `./PDF`
